@book{xieMarkdownDefinitiveGuide2018,
	abstract = {R Markdown: The Definitive Guide is the first official book authored by the core R Markdown developers that provides a comprehensive and accurate reference to the R Markdown ecosystem. With R Markdown, you can easily create reproducible data analysis reports, presentations, dashboards, interactive applications, books, dissertations, websites, and journal articles, while enjoying the simplicity of Markdown and the great power of R and other languages. 

In this book, you will learn


Basics: Syntax of Markdown and R code chunks, how to generate figures and tables, and how to use other computing languages 


Built-in output formats of R Markdown: {PDF}/{HTML}/Word/{RTF}/Markdown documents and ioslides/Slidy/Beamer/{PowerPoint} presentations 


Extensions and applications: Dashboards, Tufte handouts, xaringan/reveal.js presentations, websites, books, journal articles, and interactive tutorials 


Advanced topics: Parameterized reports, {HTML} widgets, document templates, custom output formats, and Shiny documents. 


Yihui Xie is a software engineer at {RStudio}. He has authored and co-authored several R packages, including knitr, rmarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, shiny, xaringan, and animation. He has published three other books, Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown, and blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown.

J.J. Allaire is the founder of {RStudio} and the creator of the {RStudio} {IDE}. He is an author of several packages in the R Markdown ecosystem including rmarkdown, flexdashboard, learnr, and radix.

Garrett Grolemund is the co-author of R for Data Science and author of Hands-On Programming with R. He wrote the lubridate R package and works for {RStudio} as an advocate who trains engineers to do data science with R and the Tidyverse.},
